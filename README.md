# J2V8-Debugger

This project is an add-on for the excellent [J2V8 Project](https://github.com/eclipsesource/J2V8).

It allows users to debug JS running in V8 using [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/).

Uses [Stetho](https://github.com/facebook/stetho) for communication with Chrome DevTools.
